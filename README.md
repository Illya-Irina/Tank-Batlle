# Unreal-Course

The Unreal Engine 4 Course I take on Udemy made by GameDev.TV.

Here I will upload any changes, when I remember to commit what changed and what I often neglect, that I make while going through the Unreal Course.

And sometimes it can be taken as given, because sometime Unreal is really unreal.
